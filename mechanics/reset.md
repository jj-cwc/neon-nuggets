# Introducing Initial Liquidity: Starting a NeonNuggets Game Session

As developers, when initiating a game session in NeonNuggets, it's crucial to ensure that players enter a mature trading market. The following mechanisms can be employed to simulate this mature market environment:

## 1. **Historical Trading Data**

- Provide players with historical trading data to offer a snapshot of each company's past performance.
- This data, while possibly generated algorithmically for varied gameplay experiences, should reflect realistic trends, swings, and anomalies you'd expect in a genuine market.

## 2. **Automated Traders (Bots)**

- Utilize bots to simulate the presence of seasoned traders already active in the market.
- These bots not only provide an initial sense of competition but also contribute to the market's liquidity.
- Ensure that bots possess diverse trading strategies based on the different trading "personalities" we've outlined.

## 3. **Initial Funds Allocation**

- Players should be provided with a predetermined amount of cash assets, allowing them to engage with the market immediately.
- This allocation should be balanced to prevent overpowering the player or making the initial phase too challenging.

## 4. **Archived Market News**

- Introduce past market events, announcements, and significant shifts via an archive or database.
- These past events provide context, influencing players' decisions based on historical market sentiments.

## 5. **Existing Market Liquidity**

- Ensure that the market has a diverse range of assets available, held by the bots.
- These assets create the initial pool of liquidity, ensuring that players have entities to trade with from the outset.

To summarize, the goal is to immerse the player seamlessly into an existing, mature trading environment from the moment they begin a game session. Properly balancing these elements will be crucial for maintaining gameplay interest and realism.
