**To:** All NeonNugget Securities Clients  
**From:** Chad Starlight, Chief Operating Officer, NeonNuggets Securities  
**Date:** June 19, 1986  
**Subject:** Clarification on Extra-Network Communications Policy and Market Practices

Dear esteemed clients,

As the sun sets over the golden beaches of Luminosa and the neon lights begin to shine, we felt it necessary to clarify our stance on certain market practices within our dazzling realm.

## 1. Freedom of Speech

At NeonNuggets Securities, we're all about embracing the uninhibited spirit of the '80s. Engage in lively chats outside of NuggetNet, be it over flashy landlines or during your groovy disco nights. We're not here to rain on your neon parade.

## 2. Veracity of Information

While we cheer for camaraderie and the free flow of information, remember that not everything outside the NuggetNet is as reliable as your favorite pair of leg warmers. In the glittery realm of token stocks, it's wise to tread with caution.

## 3. Market Manipulation? No Biggie

Given the... relaxed regulations of Luminosa, classic market manipulation schemes, while not exactly endorsed, aren't technically prohibited. But remember, with great power (or, in this case, lax regulations) comes great responsibility. Keep it flashy, but also classy.

## 4. Multiple Accounts â€” No Go

While we're lenient in many regards, creating multiple accounts to get a leg up in the neon game isn't allowed. That's just not how we roll in Luminosa.

## 5. Share & Enjoy

NeonFlare isn't just about trading; it's about living the high-voltage life of Luminosa. Share your stories, strategies, and everything in between. Dive deep into this world where the '80s never fade!

In wrapping up, remember that while NeonNuggets might have a satirical shimmer, our passion for creating an electric and balanced trading environment is very real. So, strap on those roller skates, and let's hit the neon strip!

**Yours in bright lights and tokens,**  
Chad Starlight  
Chief Operating Officer  
NeonNuggets Securities
